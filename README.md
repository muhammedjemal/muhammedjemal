### ‚ú® Spotlight Project: KiyaEqub - Financial Savings & Payment System

The **KiyaEqub project (kiyaequb.com)** was a significant undertaking where I played a crucial role in the full lifecycle, with a strong emphasis on **ensuring the system's quality and reliability through comprehensive testing**. This digital platform manages traditional Ethiopian savings (Equb) and incorporates payment functionalities.

My specific contributions to **system testing and quality assurance** for KiyaEqub included:

*   **End-to-End System Testing:** Validated the entire user workflow, from registration and account management to contribution processing and fund disbursement, ensuring all modules integrated correctly.
*   **Payment Transaction Testing:** Rigorously tested the payment processing modules to verify accuracy, security, and successful completion of financial transactions. This involved simulating various payment scenarios and validating ledger entries.
*   **Data Integrity Verification:** Designed and executed tests to ensure the consistency and accuracy of financial data stored within the system, particularly for user balances and transaction histories.
*   **Functional Testing of Admin Dashboard:** Ensured all administrative functionalities, including user management, payment oversight, and reporting, worked as specified.
*   **Usability & UI Testing:** Conducted tests on both the administrative web interface and the client-facing mobile application to ensure intuitive navigation and a positive user experience.
*   **Systematic Defect Management:** Diligently identified, logged, and tracked software defects, collaborating closely with development to facilitate fixes and re-test for resolution.

This project provided me with invaluable, practical experience in testing a live system that processes financial information, directly aligning with the type of meticulous quality assurance required for systems at the National Bank of Ethiopia.
